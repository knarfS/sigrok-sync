The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

The sole purpose of sigrok-sync is to synchronize the Github mirrors of the
sigrok.org project with the upstream repositories. This is done with a Github
workflow.


Status
------

sigrok-sync is in a usable state.
